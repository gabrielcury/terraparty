# Terraparty
Hey guys, I've been working on a fresh new Terraform UI called Terraparty! It currently supports 534 AWS modules with built in documentation straight from the Terraform docs. If you know what you want to build, or you're just messing around, this is a fun, simple way to spin up the scripts. 

- Give it a try! 
- Love, Mike
